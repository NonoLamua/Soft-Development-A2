#Software-Development-A2


This project simulated a software development process using Git, focusing on version control, feature development, bug fixing, and release management. The team collaborated on different branches to develop features, handle merges, and manage releases.


We had different roles and responsibilities
Antonio: Managed the `master` branch and tagged stable releases
Pablo: Overseed the `develop` branch and integrated features.
Narc√≠s, Rafa and Francisco: Worked on individual features (Feature 1, Feature 2, Feature 3), resolving conflicts and merging them into `develop`.
Rafa: Created hotfixes for bugs found in the first release.
Yago: Conducted testing, verified features, and coordinated bug fixes.


1. Project Setup: Initialized the `master` and `develop` branches.
2. Feature Development: Developed Features 1, 2, and 3 in separate branches, merging them into `develop` after testing.
3. Releases:
   - v1.00: First release after merging completed features.
   - v1.01: Hotfix for a critical bug in v1.00.
   - v1.02: Final release after all features were integrated.
4. Conflict Resolution: Merged features into `develop`, resolving conflicts manually, especially between Features 1 and 2.


- Merge Conflicts: Resolved conflicts during feature integrations and rebasing.
- Hotfixes: Addressed critical bugs post-release with a hotfix branch.
- Rebasing: Managed feature conflicts during rebasing to ensure stability.


The project demonstrated the use of Git for managing software development with multiple features and bug fixes. We successfully released versions v1.00, v1.01, and v1.02, ensuring stable product releases and effective collaboration throughout.
